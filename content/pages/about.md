`sim.ilitu.de` is my homebase on the internet, an old-school personal website, a shiny-new piece of IndieWeb.

## Who Am I?

My name is _Simon Schrape_. I am a Berlin-based web developer and musician.

## Why “similitude”?

The word _similitude_ means similarity in [multiple aspects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similitude#Overview)
of an engineering model. I like the idea of my personal website being an image of myself (to some degree).
Last but not least I love domain names that read as one word when ignoring the dots (and the hierarchy of <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr>).
And I wanted something with a reference to my first name and under an inexpensive <abbr title="top-level domain">TLD</abbr>.
