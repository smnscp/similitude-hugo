`sim.ilitu.de` is my homebase on the internet, an old-school personal website, a shiny-new piece
of IndieWeb.

## Who Am I?

My name is _Simon Schrape_. I am a Berlin-based web developer and musician.

## Why “similitude”?

The word _similitude_ means similarity in
[multiple aspects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similitude#Overview) of an engineering model. I
like the idea of my personal website being an image of myself (to some degree). Last but not
least I love domain names that read as one word when ignoring the dots (and the hierarchy of
<abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr>). And I wanted something with a reference to my
first name and under an inexpensive <abbr title="top-level domain">TLD</abbr>.

## Colophon

- static site generation with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- theme derived from [Base16 theme](https://github.com/htdvisser/hugo-base16-theme) and rebased
  on [Stylament](https://github.com/smnscp/stylament)
- default color scheme: [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/)
- comments served by [Senfdazu](https://github.com/smnscp/senfdazu)
- webmentions powered by [Webmention.io](https://webmention.io/) and displayed by
  [Webmention.js](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/webmention.js)

## Legal

This is my **personal** blog where I share my creative output with my _friends and family_.
<small>(If you are not my friend I still allow you to consume it. But you’ve been warned: It’s
personal.)</small> I do not make money with this website.
